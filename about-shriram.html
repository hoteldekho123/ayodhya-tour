                            introduction of Shri Ram's life
                        </h2>
                        <div class="about-card-content">
                            <p>Shri Rama was the elder son of King Dasharath of Ayodhya. Mata Sita was his beloved wife. Rama story was very courageous, intelligent and obedient and maa Sita was very beautiful, generous and positive. Maa Sita met to lord Rama in the Swayamvar, which was assembled by maa Sita's father king Janak of Mithila. It was organized in search of the good groom for maa Sita.In that event, many princes and kings of many states were invited.Lord Rama is the incarnation of lord Vishnu</p>
                            <p>The condition was that maa Sita will marry to that person who pulled and break lord Shiva’s bow. All the kings tried, but they could not move the bow. When the turn of Shri Ram came, Shri Ram lifted the bow with the same hand and tried to drag wire like this that the bow broke into two pieces. Thus, there is a union of Shri Ram and maa Sita.</p>
                            <h3>Ayodhya Conspiracy In Lord Rama Family</h3>
                            <p>King Dashrath of Ayodhya had three wives and four sons. Lord Ram was elder in all the brothers and his mother's name was Kaushalya. Bharat Raja was the son of Kekayi, the second and beloved wife of Dasharatha. There were two other brothers, Laxman and Satrughan whose mother's name was Sumitra.When lord Ram was preparing to make Raj Tilak on one side, his stepmother Kaikeyi was plotting to make his son Bharat a king of Ayodhya. This conspiracy was done by the old manhandra.</p>
                            <p>Rani Kekayi once had protected the life of King Dashrath, then King Dasaratha had asked him to ask for anything but Kekayi said, I will demand the time when it comes. On the strength of the same verse, Kekayi asked for the throne of Ayodhya for Raja Dasaratha's son Bharat and fourteen years of exile for Ram. lord Ram was obedient and therefore he blessed his stepmother Kekaii and left the state to spend fourteen years in exile with mother Sita and dear brother Lakshman.Raja Dasharath could not bear this infinite sadness and he died. When Kaikeyi's son Bharat came to know about this, he too refused to take the throne.</p>
                            <h3>Sita Haran(Abduction)</h3>
                            <p>Under the plan, Ravana sent the Maricha monks to Chitrakoot's cottage as a beautiful deer. When Mata Sita saw Marich, she asked Shri Ram to bring that deer to the gur. After accepting the matter of Sita, Ram went behind him after catching that deer and ordered Laxman to leave Sita and not go anywhere. After much pitch, lord Ram hit that deer with arrows. As soon as Rama's arrow became deer, Marich came in his real monster form and started calling for the help of Sita and Laxman in the voice of Ram.</p>
                            <p>When Sita saw the monstrous moan in Ram's voice, she got nervous and asked Lakshman to go to the forest to help Ram. Lakshman secured Sita's cottage from "Laxman Line" from all fours and he went to the forest to search for Shri Rama. According to the plan, Ravana reached the cottage as a monk and started the voice of Bhiksham Dehi.</p>
                            <p>As soon as Ravan got his feet on the Lakshman line near the cottage, his feet started burning, Ravan asked Mata Sita to come out and give food. As soon as Mother Sita left the Lakshman Rekha, Ravana kidnapped her in a Pushpak plane.When lord Ram and Lakshman know that they have been deceived, then they did not get any of the cottages and ran there. When Ravana was taking Sita to a Pushpak plane, the old Jatayu bird fought to rescue Sita from Ravan, but Ravana cut the wings of Jatayu.</p>
                            <p>When Shri Ram and Lakshman were going out of Sita, Jatayu's body was lying on the way and shri Ram were mourning. When Rama and Lakshman asked him about Sita, Jatayu told them that Ravan had taken Sita from the mother and told him that he died and that he died.</p>
                            <h3>Ram and Hanuman</h3>
                            <p>Hanuman was the Minister of the Vanar Sarkar of King Sugriva of Kisskindha. shri Rama story and his birth and lord Hanuman first met at Rishikukh Mountains where Sugriva and his companions lived. Sugriva's brother Bali also snatched her state from her and kept her wife in custody.When Sugriva got to Ram, they both became friends. When Ravana was taking Sita mother to Pushpak plane, Mother Sita gave her alarms for a sign, she found some apes from the army of Sugriva.</p>
                            <p>When he showed it to Shri Ram, he tears in the eyes of Ram and Lakshman. Shri Rama slaughtered Bali and made Sugriva king of Kisindha again. Sugriva also played a friendship, pledged to Ram that he and his ancestral army would also take the entire life of life to relieve Sita's mother from the clutches of Ravana.</p>
                            <h3>Ram Setu Bridge</h3>
                            <p>Now it was a matter of concern for the army of Shri Rama and Vanar how the whole army could go to the other side of the ocean. Shri Ram Ji requested the sea to give way that their army could cross the sea. But even though the sea did not listen to them, the sea did not listen to them, then Ram demanded a bow of Lakshman and the fire bowed on the ocean, from which the water could get relief and they could move forward.</p>
                            <p>As soon as Shri Ram did this, the sea god appeared scared and apologized to Shri Rama and said, "O Nath, do not do that, with this arrow, all the fish and living creatures living in me will end. Shri Ram said, 'O sea god tell us how my vast army can overcome this sea. The sea God replied - O Raghunandan Ram There are two apes in your army: Tap and Neel can swim in any of the big things in water by touching them.</p>
                            <h3>The War Between Lord Rama And Ravana Begins</h3>
                            <p>There was a fierce battle between the army of Shri Ram and Ravana. In this war, on the Lakshman Meghnad struck with power binding, due to which Hanuman Ji went to the Himalaya Mountains to take Sanjeevani Buti. But they could not trace that plant, so they had just picked up the entire Himalaya Mountains.</p>
                            <p>In this war, the army of Shri Rama of Ravan's army is present and in the end, lord Ram shoots him in Ravana's navel and kills him and Sita brings the mother back.Sri Ram makes Vibhishan the king of Lanka. With the help of Shri Ram Mata Sita and Bhai Lakshman, they return from their 14 years of exile.</p>
                            <h3>When and how lord Rama died</h3>
                            <p>Just as every person who comes into the world comes before it is fixed in his birth date before his birth. In the same way, the incarnations of Lord who were born in human form also had a fixed time on this earth, after the time of their death, they had to return their people after abolishing death. We have till now all Lord Krishna and God Laxman's death or yoose has told the story of his departure.Today we will know how Lord Shri Rama left this person and went back to lord Vishnu.</p>
                            <p>The greatest obstacle to the death of Lord Rama Story was his beloved devotee Hanuman. Because, because of Hanuman, Yama did not have so much courage that he had reached Ram. But solve it by Shri Ram himself. Let's know how Lord Rama solved this problem.One day, Ram knew that it was time to die. He knew that the one who takes birth has to die. "Let Yama come to me. Vaikuntha for me, it's time to go to my heavenly home, "he said. But the god of death, Yama, was afraid to enter Ayodhya because he feared the supreme devotee of Ram and Hanuman, the main guard of his palace.</p>
                            <p>
                                For the entry of Yama, it was necessary to remove Hanuman. Therefore, Ram dropped his ring from a hole in the palace floor and asked Hanuman to find it and bring it. Hanuman made himself shaped like a whirlpool, and just entered the hole to find that ring; that hole was not only a hole, but a tunnel was the way that went to snake town snake people. Hanuman met King Vasuki of the Nagas and told him the reason for his arrival.Vasuki Hanuman took the middle of the Naga where a ring of rings was stacked! "Here you will find the ring of Ram," Vasuki said.</p>
                            <p>anuman was thinking about how he could find him because he was like finding the needle in the straw. But fortunately, the first ring they raised was Ram's ring. Surprisingly, the second ring that he picked was also the ring of lord Rama. In fact, all the rings that were in that heap were all same. "What does this mean?" He got into thinking. Vasuki smiled and said, "The world we live in, we go through a cycle of creation and destruction. Every creation cycle of this world is called a Kalpa. Every era has four eras or four parts.</p>
                            <p>In the second part or Treta era, Ram is born in Ayodhya. An apron follows this ring and receives Ram's death on earth. Therefore it is a pile of hundreds of thousands of artifacts. All rings are real. The rings continued to grow and their piles grew bigger. There is a lot of place for the rings of future rams too. "Hanuman knew that there was no accidental occurrence of his entry into the Cobra and the mountains of the rings. It was Ram's way of explaining to him that death could not be prevented from coming. Lord Ram will get death. The world will end. But as always, the world is rebuilt and Ram will be born again.</p>
